How to Think Like a Computer Scientist

CS 1301 YouTube Channel

Comment out or delete all function calls. Only import statements, global variables, and comments are okay to be outside of your functions.

Read the entire document before starting this assignment.

The goal of this homework is for you to try your hand at some more challenging problems.

The homework will consist of 4 functions for you to implement. You have been given

HWEC.py skeleton file to fill out. However, below you will find more detailed information to complete your assignment. Read it thoroughly before you begin.

Hidden Test Cases: In an effort to encourage debugging and writing robust code, we will be including hidden test cases on Gradescope for some functions. You will not be able to see the input or output to these cases. Below is an example output from a failed hidden test case:

Written by Peter Han (phan38@gatech.edu), Brian Chuo (bchuo3@gatech.edu), Josh Tabb

(jtabb6@gatech.edu) &amp; Rajit Khanna (rkhanna23@gatech.edu)

Valid Parentheses

Function Name: validParentheses()

Parameters: a string with parentheses ( str )

Returns: valid or not ( bool )

Description: You‚Äôre trying to finish your 1301 HW but you realize your parentheses ‚Äò(‚Äò &amp; ‚Äò)‚Äô and square brackets ‚Äò[‚Äò &amp; ‚Äò]‚Äô might not be matched up correctly. Write a function that will check if your code has the correct parentheses matched up together. All other characters (letters, digits, white space, quotations, etc.) should not affect your output.

Recursive Bubble Sort

Function Name: bubbleSort()

Parameters: a list ( list ), the list‚Äôs length ( int )

Returns: None ( NoneType )

Description: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that will repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. More information can be found on how it exactly works here. A general pseudocode is provided in the link. Given the unsorted list and its length, write a function to sort the original list given without making a new list. You MUST implement this function recursively. If the list given is empty or contains 1 item, then there is nothing to sort, and thus, the list should not be altered.

Hint: You should be using loops in combination with recursion for this function.

Group Anagrams

Function Name: groupAnagrams() Parameters: list of strings ( list )

Returns: grouped anagrams ( dict )

Description: An anagram is when two words have the same letters, but they can be in a different order. For example, ab and ba have the same letters, so we can say they are anagrams. Given a list of strings, write a function that returns the strings grouped by anagrams. We want you to think about how you can use a dictionary to see if two strings have the same letters.

You should be returning a dictionary where the keys are sorted letters and the values are a list of strings that are anagrams of those letters.

Let‚Äôs explain the example from the first test case. The input list is

Our ouput should be of the form:

Since ab and ba are anagrams, we group them in a list. The key to this list in the dictionary is ab, which is ab and ba in alphabetical order. Since bb and bba don‚Äôt have any anagrams in the list, they are grouped alone in lists. The keys to these lists in the dictionary are also bb and bba in alphabetical order.

Note: You can assume that you will not have to deal with any special characters, only lowercase letters. You can also assume you won‚Äôt have to deal with any repeats in the input list.

Winter Break Planner

Description: Winter Break is almost here, which means you want to start planning some virtual hang out sessions with your friends. To do this, you will be creating 2 classes: a Friend class and a Planner class. The implementation of these classes will be explained below.

Friend

Attributes:

name ( str ): the name of the friend

__init__

addActivity

If there is already an activity planned on that day, return ‚ÄúNot possible‚Äù .

Planner

Attributes:

friendsList ( list ): list of Friend objects.

Methods:

__init__

initializes the following attributes from parameters:

friendsList ( list )

freeTime

This method should not take in any parameters.

Based on the schedules of each Friend in friendsList , this method should return a list of the days of the week when every Friend in friendsList is free (i.e. no one has an activity planned for that day).

If there are no days where everyone is free, return ‚ÄúNo one is free‚Äù .

plans

This method should take in a day of the week as a string.

This method should return a dictionary where the keys are activities, and the values are a list of the names of Friend s in friendsList who are doing the same activity on the given day. See below for an example:
